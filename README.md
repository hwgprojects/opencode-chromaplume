  <em>Sync your feathers. Code in color.</em>

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hwgprojects/opencode-chromaplume?style=flat-square&color=9b5de5) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/opencode-chromaplume?style=flat-square&color=00bbf9)

ChromaPlume brings your [VS Code Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) colors into [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). If you color-code your projects in VS Code, now your AI coding assistant matches.

## What It Does

When you open a project in OpenCode, ChromaPlume:

1. **Reads** your Peacock color from `.vscode/settings.json`
2. **Generates** a matching OpenCode theme with your accent color
3. **Applies** it automatically—no config needed

That's it. Your green backend project stays green. Your blue frontend stays blue. Zero friction.

## Why ChromaPlume?

Ever tried getting a peacock to talk to a... well, whatever bird represents OpenCode? It's a mess of incompatible feathers—uh, APIs. ChromaPlume swoops in like that one friend who speaks both languages at parties, translating between your AI coding assistant and your favorite development tools with zero drama.

- **Automatic**: Detects Peacock colors on startup
- **Featherweight**: Zero dependencies, instant sync
- **Plug-and-Plume**: Works with existing Peacock configs—no migration
- **Respectful**: Only overrides accent colors; your dark/light mode preference stays intact

## Installation

Add to your global OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-chromaplume"]
}
```

Or install locally:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugin
curl -o ~/.config/opencode/plugin/chromaplume.ts \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwgprojects/opencode-chromaplume/main/src/index.ts
```

---

## How It Works

```
Your Project/
├── .vscode/
│   └── settings.json          # Peacock stores "peacock.color" here
├── .opencode/
│   └── themes/
│       └── peacock.json       # Generated by ChromaPlume
└── opencode.json              # Auto-set to use "peacock" theme
```

ChromaPlume reads `peacock.color` or `peacock.remoteColor` and generates a minimal theme that overrides:

| Element | Dark Mode | Light Mode |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| `primary` | Your Peacock color | Your Peacock color |
| `accent` | +15% lighter | -15% darker |
| `secondary` | -15% darker | +15% lighter |
| `borderActive` | Your Peacock color | Your Peacock color |
| Markdown elements | Peacock-tinted | Peacock-tinted |

Everything else (backgrounds, text, syntax) comes from OpenCode's default theme.

## Roadmap

ChromaPlume currently does one thing well: Peacock → OpenCode sync. Here's where we're headed:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| One-way Peacock sync | Done |
| File watcher (live reload on color change) | Planned |
| Bidirectional sync (OpenCode → Peacock) | Planned |
| CLI for manual sync | Planned |
| Custom color transformations | Planned |
| Multi-editor support (beyond VS Code) | Dream |

Want to help? PRs welcome.
